## Hardware Challenges: Specification

**Challenge #0** is simple: acquire some hardware and then post in the hardware submissions #0 thread to tell us what you've gotten. Feel free to record a video too! This could be things you already have lying around, things you buy, etc. We're certainly not trying to ask anyone to overspend, though!
 

**Challenge #1**: Sense the environment in some way of your choice (light, temperature, sound, water level in your plant, etc.) and respond somehow.  Go to @211 for posting your submission.


**Challenge #2**: Affect the environment in some way of your choice (move an object, make a robot drive or fly in a controlled way, turn an appliance on/off, or even just blink an LED). Go to @212 for posting your submission.
